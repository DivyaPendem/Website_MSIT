					<p>MSIT is a 2 year intensive postgraduate degree program for all engineering (B.E. and B.Tech) graduates aspiring to be IT professionals.</p>

					<p>MSIT curriculum is designed with the fundamentals of computer science, soft skills and specializations in Software Engineering, Computer Networks, Data Analytics and Visualization, Information Secuirty and eBusiness Technologies.</p>

					<p>A major chunk of the students' workload at MSIT is devoted to "deliberate practice" through Learn by Doing projects. A successful MSIT graduate, by the end of the 2 years, demonstrates mastery level competence in computational thinking and problem solving.</p>

					<p>In the last 14 years over 1500 MSITians have shaped into stunning careers in computer science, IT and several other IT enabled domains. The well rounded MSIT curriculum with a world class learning environment prepares students to work in leading multinationals.</p>

				<h3>Consortium of Universities</h3>
				<p>A consortium of universities in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University offers the MSIT program.</p>
				<p>IIIT Hyderabad, JNTU Hyderabad, JNTU Kakinada and JNTU Ananthapur are part of the consoritum. Students are admitted to one of the 4 universities based on the order of merit.</p>
				<p>University to which the student is admitted to awards the MSIT degree upon the completion of the graduation requirements.</p>

				<h3>Learning by Doing</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>"I hear I forget.<br>&nbsp;I see and I remember.<br>&nbsp;I do and I understand."<br> - Confucius</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>MSIT courses are designed based on this philosophy. Every course features a set of compelling learn by doing projects.</p>
				<p>Students learn the concepts and then attempt the projects. The projects give ample opportunity for learning and practice.</p>
				<p>Experience on projects boots students confidence.</p>

			<div class="col-md-4 bs-callout bs-callout-info">
				<h3>Mentor Model</h3>
				<p>Every student has unique capabilities. MSIT learn by doing projects are a great way for the students to showcase their talent to the world.</p>
				<p>Our 1:10 mentor to student ratio gives our mentors an opportunity to work with their students in a personalized manner.</p>
				<p>Students are given projects and they are stuck. Mentors recover them by giving examples and guide them to finish. During the project students learn a lot from the mistakes they make and from the mentor's feedback.</p>
				<p>Mentors take on the role as guardians to the students. They constantly motivate them, keep them on track and help them learning better.</p>

				<h3>IT Core Curriculum</h3>
				<p>To graduate every students needs 160 IT credits and 40 Soft Skills credits.</p>
				<p>There are several programming courses begining with an Introduction to Programming, Object Oriented Programming, 3 courses on Algorithms and Data Structures and a continuous programming course.</p>
				<p>Students learn Databases, Web Development, Software Engineering, Operating Systems and Computer Networks to finish the first year course load.</p>
